\section{Overview}
For our last lab (\textbf{April 26}), each of you will give a presentation on an astronomy topic of your choice.  I have provided a list of suggested topics here, but you are welcome to come up with a topic of your own.  All topics must be approved by me by Friday \textbf{April 15}; since everyone must present on a different topic, topics will be approved on a first-come, first-serve basis.  This is your opportunity to explore something that intrigues \textit{you} about astronomy and to share that with me and your classmates -- so, have fun with your presentations!  Class on April 19 will be set aside for presentation  preparation. I'm also available by email or by appointment if you have any questions or would like to practice your talk.

\section{Guidelines}
\subsection*{Preparation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You should submit your presentation slides along with a list of resources used (e.g., research papers, popular science articles, websites, books, etc.) by midnight on April 25 (i.e., the night before the presentations). You should also include references in your presentation where appropriate; no special formatting or citation style is needed.
    \item Keep in mind that it is often more compelling to discuss one or a few specific topics rather than to gloss over a wide range of content.
\end{itemize}
\subsection*{Presentations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Presentations should be less than \textbf{10 minutes in length}
    \item Each presentation will be followed by a \textbf{5 minute question period}
    \item You may use any combination of slides and/or whiteboard
    \item All listeners will be required to give feedback to the presenters. On the day of the presentations, printed feedback forms will be provided with the following questions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What's one thing you learned and/or enjoyed in this presentation?
        \item What's one strength of the presentation that aided clarity, engagement?
        \item If you were to give the same talk, what would you change to convey
            the ideas more clearly?
    \end{itemize}
    \item Come ready to ask questions during and after each talk; questions will count towards your participation grade. Any type of question is welcome (e.g., asking the presenter to clarify a statement, asking the presenter for more background information, asking the presenter hypothetical questions based on relevant scenarios) -- remember, there's no such thing as a bad questions! 
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Grading}
This project will constitute 15\% of your final grade: 10\% for the presentation and 5\% for your participation. Here is a rubric\footnote{Chiefly adapted from the American Astronomical Society---Chambliss award rubric.} for your presentation:

\noindent
\textbf{Content: 70\%}
\begin{itemize}
%\itemsep0em
\item (35\%) Presenter introduces and describe(s) topic at level appropriate to this class [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (40\%) Presenter explains extent of and limitations on our knowledge on the topic, including data/observations underlying knowledge [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (20\%) Presenter provides context by drawing connections to, e.g., different areas of astronomy, concepts from lab or
lecture, other areas of science, areas outside of science, etc. [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (5\%) Presenter chooses and cites appropriate references (i.e., goes beyond Wikipedia and popular press releases).  Presenter submits reference list. [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\end{itemize} 

\noindent
\textbf{Delivery: 30\%}
\begin{itemize}
\item (35\%) Presentation has a logical flow that audience can follow [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (25\%) Presenter can address reasonable audience questions [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (20\%) Presentation aids (slides or board-work) are understood by audience [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (10\%) Presenter stays within allotted time [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\item (10\%) Presenter speaks clearly, and keeps the audience engaged (questions, activities, etc.) [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}]
\end{itemize}
{\small [\underline{\hspace{5mm}}] = easily and concisely (4), sufficiently (3),
is somewhat able to (2), barely to did not (1)

\section{Suggested topics}

Please submit your proposed topics by midnight on April 15.

\medskip \noindent
A non-comprehensive list of suggested topics can be found below. You can choose something not listed, so long as it's within the realm of stars, galaxies, cosmology, or related topics relevant to our lab's focus area. It should be something you haven't covered in depth in class or in this lab.

\medskip \noindent
Remember, more focused/specific topics often yield more compelling presentations (and are often better suited for 10-minute presentations):

\medskip \noindent
\textbf{Good topic:} ``The Great Red Spot and other storms, vortices, and zonal flows on
Jupiter.''

\noindent
\textbf{Not-as-good topic:} ``Gas giant atmospheres.''

Here are some broad suggested topics; you will likely want to focus on a more specific aspect of your topic of choice.

%Other options (equally encouraged):
%\begin{itemize}    
    
    %I recommend looking at the Daily Paper
%        Summaries on Astrobites (\url{https://astrobites.org/}).  This is a
%        blog that summarizes scientific papers at an introductory level;
%        summaries are written by astro graduate students and aimed for
%        undergrad/grad students alike.
%        Other sources of brief, accessible scientific papers include Nature
%        (\url{https://www.nature.com/}), Nature Astronomy
%        (\url{https://www.nature.com/natastron/}), and
%        Science (\url{https://www.sciencemag.org/}).
